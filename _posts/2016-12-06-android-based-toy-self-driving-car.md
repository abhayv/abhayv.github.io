# Android based toy self driving car

I am working on building a toy car for trying out various automation techniques for self driving cars. While not the real deal, this lets me play with lane detection, object detection, localization, path planning, sensor fusion and control techniques.

I started with the assumption that Android would be a good platform to experiment upon as most modern phones have a reasonably fast processor, plenty of memory and a range of sensor including camera, accelerometer, and GPS. The electric motor and the associated board can be completely dumb, just taking commands from the Android device. Think if the phone as the car with the motor and board just the wheels of the car.
