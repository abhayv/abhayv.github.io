# Abhay Vardhan

I am passionate about artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.  I love working at the intersection of cutting edge research and technology that will transform the world.

I am currently at Aurora Innovation where I work in the Localization team. Previously, I was at Uber ATG where I work in the trucks team solving problems in driving on highways.

At Uber, I also got a chance to work earlier in the India Growth team. Our team was the one that introduced cash payments at Uber which has now become the dominant payment method for emerging markets. I worked closely with product managers and operation teams to brainstorm and drive ideas for growth in India. The team saw Uber grow from a minuscule player to a dominant one in India.

Previously, I was the co-founder of Blippy. We raised Series-A, and grew the team to 8 people. We worked on various mobile communication app and got some traction but ultimately it was not enough to justify growing the business. The experience really honed my product thinking and my entrepreneur skills and professionally was one of the most rewarding periods of my life. 

I have a PhD in Computer Science from University of Illinois where I worked on using learning techniques for verification of software systems.

After my PhD, I joined Google in the web search team and got hands-on experience in ranking, search evaluation and analysis of large amounts of data.
