<h1>Abhay Vardhan</h1>
<p>
I am a software engineer and an entrepreneur with deep experience in web, data processing, backend systems, and machine learning. I am currently an engineer at Uber. At Uber, I have seen the engineering team grow from around a hundred people to a few thousand. It has been a privilege to work with passionate people solving hard problems which affect millions across the globe.
Previously, I was the co-founder of <a href="http://blippy.com">Blippy</a>, a cool way to discover GIFs and share them with your friends.
</p><p>
I have a PhD in Computer Science from University of Illinois where I worked on using learning techniques for verification of software systems.
After my PhD, I joined Google in the web search team and got hands-on experience in ranking, search evaluation and analysis of large amounts of data.
</p><p>
I am fascinated by the recent advances in Machine Learning, AI and autonomous vehicles. As many others believe, we are just getting started. The confluence of large amounts of data, computing resources is leading a revolution in computers helping us solve problems that were previously considered to be too hard. This has the potential of transforming our society. A good example of this is self driving technology which is disrupting how people move around.  I have been following up on the advances made in deep learning, computer vision, robotics with a particular focus on self driving cars. I have avidly consumed various the AI related classes at <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/">Stanford</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013">Udacity</a> and on the web and have been recently working on a project in my spare time to use an Android based toy car and simulation environments to try out various techniques for automation.
