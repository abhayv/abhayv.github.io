<h1>Abhay Vardhan</h1>
<p>
I am an entreprenuer and hacker with deep experience in mobile apps, consumer web, analytics, search and big data. I am the co-founder of <a href="http://blippy.com">Blippy</a>, a cool way to discover GIFs and share them with your friends.
</p>
<p>
The story of my work life starts in Urbana, Illinois where I joined Motorola and helped develop one of the very first implementations of Bluetooth on mobile phones. I was always passionate about programming and software, so I decided to pursue a PhD at the University of Illinois while working.
</p><p>
After completing my PhD, I decided to take up a new challenge and moved to California to join Google. Here, I worked in the core web search team where I got hands-on experience in building huge scale systems and worked on challenging problems in ranking, search evaluation and analysis of large amounts of data.
</p><p>
I could not resist startups for too long. I joined <a href="http://bloomreach.com">BloomReach</a>, where, as the first hire, I helped build the core search based relevance engine. The BloomReach experience was an eye opener and directly inspired me to launch Blippy.
